Open up <tt>AppleScript_SpotifyPlaylistTrigger.scpt</tt> on this repo.

Click <tt>View Raw</tt> to download the AppleScript. Open up the file after download to open it up in AppleScript Editor.

Paste your copied Spotify URI into this area of the script - <tt>play track "ENTER SPOTIFY PLAYLIST URI HERE"</tt>. DO NOT delete the quotes or the script will not work.

Go to <tt>File -> Save</tt> and give the application a name. For File Format, select <tt>Application</tt> on the Dropdown menu. Save it to a location of your choosing(ideally a location that will be easy to navigate to upon saving.)

Doubleclick your app and it should appear on your bottom bar. This will trigger the AppleScript to open Spotify and select a song at random from the specified playlist in the script.

Enjoy!
